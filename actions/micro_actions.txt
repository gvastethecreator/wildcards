adjusting cuff subtly
half-smile forming
eyes linger then dart away
breath held before speaking
fingers drum a silent rhythm
tilting head to catch meaning
weight shifting from heel to toe
hand hovers then withdraws
glance over shoulder
lip curls in doubt
brows knit then release
nostrils flare slightly
chin lifts in defiance
cheeks flush and fade
blink longer than usual
hands open then close
shoulders drop with relief
voice catches on a word
throat cleared softly
foot taps in impatience
