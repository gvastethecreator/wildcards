hourglass that drains upward
compass pointing to memories
book that writes back
lantern with bottled dawn
key to unopened doors
mask that remembers faces
coin with three faces
mirror that reflects tomorrow
violin that plays silence
quill that inks in light
teacup that warms souls
ring that forgets its owner
map that redraws itself
stone that floats when named
glove that catches shadows
camera that erases itself
locket with infinite portraits
watch that loses minutes
candle that chills rooms
scarf that hides the wearer
