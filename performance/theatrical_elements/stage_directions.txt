Enter stage left urgently
Exit stage right slowly
Cross downstage center
Move upstage gradually
Circle around protagonist
Freeze in tableau position
Gesture emphatically overhead
Kneel downstage reverently
Stand on elevated platform
Pace nervously across stage
Turn back to audience
Face audience directly
Bow deeply with respect
Curtsy gracefully formal
Point accusingly dramatic
Embrace passionately romantic
Recoil in horror shocked
Collapse dramatically defeated
Rise triumphantly victorious
Walk with regal dignity
