in the witching hour
at the crack of dawn

when the stars are bright

during the solstice
during the equinox
when the tide is high
when the tide is low
during high noon
in the dead of night
at the stroke of midnight
when time stands still
in a moment frozen in time
during the passage of time
in another era
in ancient times
in modern times
in the future
in the past
in the present moment
when history was made
during a pivotal moment
at a turning point
in a fleeting instant
for an eternity
in the blink of an eye
when seconds count
during overtime
after hours
before opening
during closing time
when the world sleeps
when the city awakens
