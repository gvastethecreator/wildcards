adjusting cuff subtly
half-smile forming
eyes linger then dart away
breath held before speaking
fingers drum a silent rhythm
tilting head to catch meaning
weight shifting from heel to toe
hand hovers then withdraws
glance over shoulder
lip curls in doubt
brows knit then release
nostrils flare slightly
chin lifts in defiance
cheeks flush and fade
blink longer than usual
hands open then close
shoulders drop with relief
voice catches on a word
throat cleared softly
foot taps in impatience
gaze drops to floor
fingers trace table edge
thumb rubs palm
jaw clenches briefly
teeth catch lower lip
fingers comb through hair
hand rests over heart
eyes narrow with focus
eyebrow arches high
nose scrunches softly
shoulders hunch inward
arms fold loosely
fingers lace behind back
palm presses against wall
toe draws circles
heel lifts repeatedly
head tilts back to listen
eyes close to savor scent
cheeks puff with exhale
fingers snap softly
knuckles crack in sequence
fingertips tap collarbone
hand covers grin
eyes widen then settle
gaze flicks to exit
fingers pinch bridge of nose
thumb hooks belt loop
palm smooths sleeve
hand rests on cheek
shoulders shake with silent laugh
fingers curl around pendant
index finger traces scar
tongue presses against teeth
nostrils flare with amusement
lips purse then part
hand adjusts glasses
eyes follow drifting dust
finger taps temple
hand tugs earlobe
breath whistles through teeth
fingers splay outward
palm opens upward
brow furrows thoughtfully
gaze softens briefly
hand presses throat
elbows brace on knees
finger drums on mug
shoulders tense then ease
heel grinds into ground
knuckles whiten on grip
gaze tracks invisible line
head shakes fractionally
nails trace tabletop grain
lips mouth silent words
eyes scan horizon
hand adjusts scarf
thumb skims jawline
forehead rests against glass
fingers trace pendant chain
knee bounces subtly
hand pats pocket
eyes cloud with memory
fingertips brush photograph
shoulders square deliberately
lips curl into sneer
gaze hardens to steel
hand forms loose fist
breath hitches mid-sentence
fingers trail along railing
hand waves dismissively
eyes roll skyward
head nods faintly
brow lifts questioningly
lips twitch into smirk
gaze drops to hands
foot slides backward
shoulders rise in shrug
eyes squint against sun
hand shields eyes
fingers tug glove cuffs
eyebrow quivers
mouth corners sag
hand squeezes shoulder
gaze mirrors companion
fingers trail over book spine
thumb taps phone case
hand rubs tired eyes
shoulders lean into wall
finger traces condensation
lips brush knuckles
arms stretch overhead quietly
gaze settles on floor tiles
palm presses table firmly
head tilts to hide smile
foot nudges pebble
fingertips skim water surface
hand clenches hemline
eyes linger on doorway
shoulders brace against chill
breath steadies then releases
