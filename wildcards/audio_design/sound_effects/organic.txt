Heartbeat rhythmic pumping
Breathing deep meditation
Footsteps on different surfaces
Bone cracking joints
Muscle stretching tension
Hair rustling movement
Skin friction rubbing
Teeth grinding stress
Stomach rumbling hunger
Blood rushing vessels
Nervous system tingling
Brain electrical activity
Eye blinking moisture
Throat swallowing reflex
Lung air expansion
Digestive system gurgling
Nervous laughter bubbling
Emotional sobbing release
Physical exhaustion panting
Adrenaline rush trembling
