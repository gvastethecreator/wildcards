Tea ceremony steam spiral
Coming-of-age hair cutting
First hunt painted cheeks
Harvest festival lanterns
Wedding knot tying
Funeral coin on tongue
Warrior tattooing drum beat
Oath under ancient tree
Name day river blessing
Crowning with laurel
Firewalking communal chant
Salt circle house blessing
New boat breaking champagne
Mask dance for spirits
Solstice bonfire leap
Ancestor altar incense
Rite of apprenticeship tool gift
Trial by silence vigil
Pilgrimage first footprint
Feast of lights window glow
